# GraphStructures
Repository to store and share graph structures for GraSP 

# Requirements

This repository contains graphs for the [GraSP](https://github.com/STAC-USC/GraSP) toolbox.
The `.mat` files just need to be loaded using `load('filename.mat')` in matlab.

An equivalent graph may or may not be available for the GSPbox in the form of a file `..._gspbox.mat`.
These are generated using `grasp_to_gspbox`, and they may or may not work with GSPbox.

## Toy Graph for GSP Examples

The graph in [ToyGraphGSPExample/](ToyGraphGSPExample/) is meant to illustrate on a simple small graph
graph GSP methods and concepts. In particular, this graph has been used in 
[10.1109/JPROC.2018.2820126](https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2018.2820126).
